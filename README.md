#Synopsis

Smir is a weather app that was created not only to tell you the weather of a specific location, but also to educate the user as to how that weather would be described in Scotland. Scottish people have an entertaining array or words to descibe just about anthing, especially the weather. Baltic, chanking, Roastit, taps-aff, el Scorchio, pishin doon... you will learn them all over time with this app. 

#Motivation

I wanted to take some time to work within a framework that was aimed at mobile development. I found a number of online resouces that showed how to work with a weather API and I wanted to add a touch of my own personality to the project.
